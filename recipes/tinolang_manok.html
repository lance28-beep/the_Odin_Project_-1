    <p>
      <strong><em>Tinolang Manok</em></strong> is a great tasting and healthy
      dish to prepare for your family. It is easy to cook and friendly on the
      budget. I like the idea of having tinolang manok at least once per week
      (particularly during cold weather) because it keeps me stay warm and it is
      also one of my comfort foods.
